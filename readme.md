## Before the Interview

1. You will need to clone this repository.
2. Install Java 8 or newer if you haven't already.
3. Install your favourite IDE and open this project in it.
4. Check you can run the project:
    - If you already have Maven installed, you should be able to run `mvn spring-boot:run`.
    - If you don't have Maven installed, you may be able to run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (macOs & Linux), or `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` (Windows).
5. Once the project is running you can browse to [http://localhost:8080] in your browser.  

## About the Project

The project is a Spring Boot example forked from <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic>.

By default, it uses a H2 in-memory, so any changes made to the data will be reset when the application is restarted.
